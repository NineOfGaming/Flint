## Features

### Feature Management

Mods can define features, classes that implement a **FeatureTrait**.

#### Feature Traits

- **ChatListeningFeature** - Listen to chat messages
- **CommandFeature** - Register a command with aliases
- **ModeSwitchListeningFeature** - Listen to mode switches
- **PacketListeningFeature** - Listen to incoming and outgoing packets
- **PlotSwitchListeningFeature** - Listen to plot switches
- **RenderedFeature** - Run code when a frame is rendered
- **ShutdownFeature** - Run code when the game is shutting down
- **TickedFeature** - Run code every tick
- **TooltipRenderFeature** - Run code when a tooltip is rendered, allowing you to modify it
- **UserCommandListeningFeature** - Run code when the player runs a command, lets you to modify or cancel the command
- **UserMessageListeningFeature** - Run code when the player sends a message, lets you to modify or cancel the message
- **WorldRenderFeature** - Listen to world render events

#### Registering features

To register a feature, in your mod's onInitializeClient,
call **FlintAPI.registerFeature(FeatureTrait)** or **FlintAPI.registerFeature(FeatureTrait...)**.

```java
public class Flint implements ClientModInitializer {

    @Override
    public void onInitializeClient() {
        FlintAPI.registerFeatures(
                new AwesomeFeature()
        );

    }

}
```

### Message System

Send formatted messages with ease using messages.

```java
public void success() {

    Flint.getUser().sendMessage(new CompoundMessage(
            new SuccessMessage("my_mod.awesome_success"),
            new SoundMessage(FSound.builder()
                    .setSound(SoundEvents.ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP)
                    .setPitch(1.5F)
                    .build()
            )
    ));

}
```

### Color Palette

The library provides a color palette for easy access to beautiful colors.

```java
public void error() {

    Component.text("You did something BAD!", PaletteColor.RED);

}
```

### Mode Tracking

Flint tracks the user's current mode and optionally the plot and node they are on, you can access this info using
**Flint.getUser().getMode()**, **Flint.getUser().getPlot()**, and **Flint.getUser().getNode()**.

```java
public boolean shouldShowPlotOverlay() {
    return Flint.getUser().getMode() == Mode.PLAY && Flint.getUser().getPlot().handle() == "myplot";
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You only have access to the user's plot if **FlintAPI.confirmLocationWithLocate()** was called, if you are not
> calling this on your own, remember that you will get null when calling **Flint.getUser().getPlot()**!
>
> This makes Flint run /locate every time a suspected mode change occurs.
> Not only does this give you access to the plot the user is on, but it also makes mode tracking more accurate.

## ActionDump

The actiondump is stored in separate files for each color mode access them in the flint files,
for a & color syntax actiondump you would use `FlintFile.ACTION_DUMP_AMPERSAND.getPath()`,
you need to read the files on your own.
To receive each version log into Node Beta and run `/getactiondump <color mode>`.

### DFItem

TODO

### Useful Classes

#### Mode

An enum containing every mode the user can be in,
you can check whether a mode means the user is in a plot
or if they are in a mode that allows them to modify a plot with `Mode.isInPlot()` and `Mode.isEditor()` respectively.

#### Plot

A record that stores surface level information about a plot, such as the plot's name, id, and handle.

#### Node

An enum of every node on DiamondFire, you can get a node's ID with `Node.getId()` or its name with `Node.getName()`. Get
a node by its id or name using `Node.fromId()` or `Node.fromName()` respectively.

#### Toaster

Lets you send toasts with `Toaster.toast(Component title, Component message)`.

#### RateLimiter

A rate limiter that can be used to limit the rate at which code is executed.

## How to install

Either grab the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/dFOnline/flint/releases/latest) or
on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/flint).

## Depending on Flint

Use the Modrinth Maven repository to depend on Flint in your project.

### What version?
Flint updates on a **rolling release** schedule, once a push is made to the main branch, a new version is released.
The latest release will be the most recent GitHub release, or other most recent release on Modrinth.

Starting with the release containing this change, each published build uses its rolling release number as its Fabric mod version.  
For example, GitHub/Modrinth release `v123` has the Fabric version `123`.  
This lets your mod require the oldest compatible Flint build in `fabric.mod.json`:

```json
{
  "depends": {
    "flint": ">=123"
  }
}
```

Fabric will then prevent the mod from loading with an older Flint build.  
The `v` prefix is part of the release and Modrinth Maven version name, but is not part of the Fabric version.

### Build Script Example

> [!WARNING]
> Don't include Flint in your mod jar, users should get Flint themselves so it can be updated independently, additionally, if you do include it your mod will have to match Flint's license.

```gradle
repositories {
    // This is the recommended way to add the Modrinth Maven repository.
    exclusiveContent {
        forRepository {
            maven {
                name = "Modrinth"
                url = "https://api.modrinth.com/maven"
            }
        }
        filter {
            includeGroup "maven.modrinth"
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    // Use modApi to gain access to Flint's classes.

    // Flint
    modApi("maven.modrinth:flint:${project.flint_version}")

    // Flint depends on Adventure,
    // loom doesn't resolve dependencies of dependencies
    // so you need to include it in your project yourself.

    // Adventure
    modImplementation include("net.kyori:adventure-platform-fabric:${project.adventure_fabric_version}") {
        exclude group: "net.fabricmc.fabric-api"
    }

}
```
